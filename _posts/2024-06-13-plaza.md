I am proposing today that Polkadot should consolidate and extend the functionality of its various 
system chains into a single hub for activity, to be known as the Plaza chain. This system chain
should be an evolution of the current AssetHub chain, which already has strong exchange, wallet, 
bridging, and tooling integrations that can and should be preserved.

Concretely, the proposal is to consolidate all the following features into a single parachain up
to the maximum possible scale:
  1. Asset Issuance
  2. Smart Contracts (Rust and EVM via RISC-V/PolkaVM)
  3. Staking
  4. Bridging Pallets
  5. Near-zero fees (until scaling limits are reached)

The current trend of Polkadot is to split these functionalities across several different chains,
and for wallets, applications, and users to coordinate their activities across these chains. This
approach has come with real costs. 

For users, interacting with the platform is more complex,
requiring them to juggle assets, accounts, and state across several different chains. Wallet and
frontend developers have taken on large amounts of work to make this easier, but are still less
than perfect. For developers, the time and money costs of building a chain, coordinating a collator 
set, handling block explorers, indexing, bridging, and exchange integrations add a large amount of
overhead against building the products they wish to bring to the world.

These costs are worthwhile and even necessary once the scaling limits of a single chain have been 
reached, but are a poor trade-off until that point. I believe we should work together as an
ecosystem to bring a batteries-included single chain, the Plaza, up to its point of bursting and 
only then relieve the pressure by spinning out apps, users, and system functionality. Polkadot has the cores to 
support all of this to the level of scale the world needs. The city needs to grow outwards from the 
center, and that center should be the Plaza.

Although not included in the original list, there is also strong case to add identity and 
governance functionality to the Plaza. Direct integration between smart contracts, identity, and
governance enables powerful scripting and automation primitives to enhance these systems and
broaden their usage and could be considered for inclusion in the Plaza.

With engineering advances like [NOMT](./2024-05-19-introducing-nomt.md) and 
[Elastic Scaling](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-elastic-scaling), the plaza chain will 
be able to support many thousands of transactions per second. Looking at further technologies like
Optimistic Concurrency Control, ZK Merkle Proving, and full nodes without state tries, the scaling
limits for a single chain can go substantially higher without compromising on requiring only normal hardware
for a full node. I am not talking about using supercomputer sequencers, just normal machines with good
software engineering. We should use this to our advantage to provide a hub with near-zero fees, 
an easy developer experience, and strong integrations with exchanges and other L1 systems. 

Another element of the Plaza is the potential for value accrual to DOT through transaction ordering
priority fees. I [have written on twitter](https://x.com/rphmeier/status/1797339044893917397) that
I don't believe trying to _sell all the blockspace_ is the best strategy, particularly because 
[the price of cryptoeconomic compute is bounded-above by the cost of ZK](./2024-03-04-coprocessor-competition.md)
and because Polkadot has been so successful in scaling raw compute. However, not all blockspace
is created equal. Oftentimes, having the first transaction in a block is valuable in itself, even 
when blocks are nowhere near full. **This is important: even when blockspace is abundant, the first 
transaction in a batch is a scarce resource that people will pay for.** 
One example of this phenomenon is in market making:
when the price of an asset moves between blocks, the first transaction often has access to a "free"
arbitrage. With high concentrations of liquidity, this arbitrage can be quite large and
being the first user to make that trade in each block can be quite valuable. This race to be first
is always the case in financial markets, and presents a viable opportunity for token value accrual, 
for example, by burning priority fees in part.

A sketch of the plan is a series of RFCs, progressively improving the usability of Plaza:
  1. Wish-for-Change RFC to put the Plaza plan in action and rename AssetHub.
  1. Reduce existential deposits on Plaza substantially.
  1. Reduce base transaction fees on Plaza: base-fee, fee-per-byte, and target 75% block fullness.
  1. Add PolkaVM/RISC-V contract execution capabilities to parachains, with existential deposits for
     per-byte contract storage usage.
  1. Introduce a priority-fee mechanism enabling auctions for top-of-block execution and start a 
     value-capture flywheel.
  1. Revive the Storage pallet from the CoreGap RFC (superseded by JAM) for smart contract code
     storage to avoid bloating PoVs with code. 
  1. Integrate NOMT into the Plaza node and migrate the state to the binary trie format.
  1. Activate elastic scaling for Plaza once ready.

We can and should get started now. We should build something like New York City, Dubai, London,
or Shenzhen as a precursor to greater expansion, knowing that when the Plaza is saturated Polkadot
(or JAM) has the raw validated compute power needed to handle that expansion.
