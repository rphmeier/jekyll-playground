I am proposing today that Polkadot should consolidate and extend the functionality of its various 
system chains into a single hub for activity, to be known as the Plaza chain. This system chain
should be an evolution of the current AssetHub chain, which already has strong exchange, wallet, 
bridging, and tooling integrations that can and should be preserved.

Concretely, the proposal is to consolidate all the following features into a single parachain up
to the maximum possible scale:
  1. Asset Issuance
  2. Smart Contracts (Rust and EVM via PolkaVM)
  3. Staking
  4. Identity
  5. Near-zero fees (until scaling limits are reached)

The current trend of Polkadot is to split these functionalities across several different chains,
and for wallets, applications, and users to coordinate their activities across these chains. This
approach has come with real costs. 

For users, interacting with the platform is more complex,
requiring them to juggle assets, accounts, and state across several different chains. Wallet and
frontend developers have taken on large amounts of work to make this easier, but are still less
than perfect. For developers, the time and money costs of building a chain, coordinating a collator 
set, handling block explorers, indexing, bridging, and exchange integrations add a large amount of
overhead against building the products they wish to bring to the world.

These costs are worthwhile and even necessary once the scaling limits of a single chain have been 
reached, but are a poor trade-off until that point. I believe we should work together as an
ecosystem to bring a batteries-included single chain, the Plaza, up to its point of bursting and 
only then relieve the pressure by spinning out apps, users, and system functionality. Polkadot has the cores to 
support all of this to the level of scale the world needs. The city needs to grow outwards from the 
center, and that center should be the Plaza.

With engineering advances like [NOMT](./2024-05-19-introducing-nomt.md) and 
[Elastic Scaling](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-elastic-scaling), the plaza chain will 
be able to support many thousands of transactions per second. We should use this to our advantage 
to provide a hub with near-zero fees, an easy developer experience, and strong integrations with 
exchanges and other L1 systems. We should build something like New York City, Dubai, London, 
or Shenzhen. It will be a precursor to greater expansion.
