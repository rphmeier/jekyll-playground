Today, we get the ball rolling on a proposal codenamed "Plaza", where Polkadot would 
consolidate functionality into a single highly-scalable system chain as a hub for users, developers,
liquidity, and apps. This system chain could be an evolution of the current AssetHub chain, which 
already has strong exchange, wallet, bridging, and tooling integrations that can be preserved to 
build momentum.

Concretely, the proposal is to consolidate all the following features into a single parachain up
to the maximum possible scale:
  1. Asset Issuance
  2. Smart Contracts (Rust and EVM via RISC-V/PolkaVM)
  3. Staking
  4. Bridging Pallets
  5. Near-zero fees (until scaling limits are reached)

The current trend of Polkadot is to split these functionalities across several different chains,
and for wallets, applications, and users to coordinate their activities across these chains. This
approach has come with real costs, without a current driving scaling pressure to merit this level
of fragmentation. 

Essentially, we should be strategic and concentrate hard on usability now that we've
laid the groundwork for scalability. There are two ways to do this. Option 1 is the status quo:
we spend a lot of money and time to build the best asynchronous composability framework possible and
hope this is easy enough to compete with synchronous systems once it is done. Option 2 is to focus 
scaling resources and energy on building a synchronous system which we know will have scaling 
limits and let organic scaling pressures lead the way once those limits are saturated. This is the
"option 2" proposal.

Polkadot will soon have [Elastic Scaling][ES], where a single chain will be able to use
a large number of cores to process transactions - logically sequential, synchronously composable,
and validated in parallel across many cores. I believe we should use this to our advantage to create 
a "hub" to focus UX, integration, and developer efforts on, and we should lay the groundwork for 
this today. We can scale this chain to thousands of TPS today and much further over time. The
scaling limits of a single chain are going to be saturated, very conservatively, with tens of 
millions of daily users.

Smart contract support is absolutely crucial. Assets, staking, bridging, and apps benefit from
generalizable programmability. This is lacking in the current Polkadot landscape, with smart
contracts generally separated from the functionality they wish to program. We can support RISC-V
smart contracts via [PolkaVM][PolkaVM], and with it, gain support for new languages like ink! as
well as interpreted EVM.

Here are the specific difficulties the Plaza plan can address. 
For users, interacting with multiple chains is more complex,
requiring them to juggle assets, accounts, and state across several different chains. Wallet and
frontend developers have taken on large amounts of work to make this easier, but are still less
than perfect. For developers, the time and money costs of building a chain, coordinating a collator 
set, handling block explorers, indexing, bridging, and exchange integrations add a large amount of
overhead against building the products they wish to bring to the world.

These costs are worthwhile and even necessary once the scaling limits of a single chain have been 
reached, but are a poor trade-off until that point. We should work together as an
ecosystem to bring a batteries-included single chain up to its point of bursting and 
only then relieve the pressure by spinning out apps, users, and system functionality. Polkadot has the cores to 
support all of this to the level of scale the world needs. The city needs to grow outwards from the 
center, and that center should be the Plaza.

Although not included in the list of core functionality, there is a case to integrate Polkadot's 
identity and governance functionality to the Plaza over time. 
Tight integration between smart contracts, assets, identity, and governance enables powerful 
scripting and automation primitives to enhance these systems and broaden their usage and could be 
considered for inclusion in the Plaza.

With engineering advances like [NOMT][NOMTDB], Optimistic Concurrency Control, and ZK Merkle Proving,
we can build this "plaza" chain to support hundreds of millions of transactions per day over time.
I am not talking about using supercomputer sequencers, but just normal machines with good
software engineering. Accessibility for full nodes to join the network should remain a priority 
and we don't need to compromise on this.

Another element of the Plaza is the potential for value accrual to DOT through transaction ordering
priority fees. I [have written on twitter](https://x.com/rphmeier/status/1797339044893917397)
recently that I don't believe trying to _sell all the blockspace_ is the best strategy, particularly 
because [the price of cryptoeconomic compute is bounded-above by the cost of ZK][COPROCESSORS]
and because Polkadot has been so successful in scaling raw compute. However, not all blockspace
is created equal. Oftentimes, having the first transaction in a block is valuable in itself, even 
when blocks are nowhere near full. **This is important: even when blockspace is abundant, the first 
transaction in a batch is a scarce resource that people will pay for.** To take advantage of this,
we need synchronous composability and programmability.

One example of this phenomenon is in market making:
when the price of an asset moves between blocks, the first transaction often has access to a "free"
arbitrage. With high concentrations of liquidity, this arbitrage can be quite large and
being the first user to make that trade in each block is a good worth paying for. 
This race to be first is always the case in financial markets, and presents a viable opportunity 
for token value accrual, for example, by burning priority fees in part. The story I present here is
one where the median fee is near zero but the mean fee is enough to cover the cost of blockspace.

I suggest that this plan be implemented as a series of RFCs. progressively improving the
usability of the "plaza". This will be a progressive effort, and some of these have already begun:
  1. Wish-for-Change RFC to put the Plaza plan in action.
  1. Reduce existential deposits on Plaza substantially.
  1. Reduce base transaction fees on Plaza: base-fee, fee-per-byte, and target 75% block fullness.
  1. Add PolkaVM/RISC-V contract execution capabilities to the chain, with existential deposits for
     per-byte contract storage usage.
  1. Introduce a priority-fee mechanism enabling auctions for top-of-block execution and start a 
     value-capture flywheel.
  1. Revive the Storage pallet from the CoreGap RFC (superseded by JAM) for smart contract code
     storage to avoid bloating PoVs with code. 
  1. Migrate the state of the Plaza to a binary trie format to reduce merkle trie data overhead and 
     enable more work with fewer cores.
  1. Activate elastic scaling for Plaza once ready.

This post is a precursor to a formal proposal to Polkadot Governance, 
and is an invitation for discussion, debate, and collaboration, as well as a call to action.

My vision here is that this will be the New York City, Dubai, London, or Shenzhen of the Polkadot
continent, the first megacity of many and a precursor to greater expansion. We can implement this
plan eagerly, knowing that when the Plaza is saturated Polkadot (or JAM) has the raw validated 
compute power needed to handle that expansion. Here's to doing things that don't scale, but scale
far enough to get us to the next era.
