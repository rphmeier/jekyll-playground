  <p>
    I was a day-0 contributor and leader of the Polkadot Network, a 3rd-generation blockchain for heterogeneous sharding, scalability, and community governance.
    From 2017 onwards, I designed and wrote the vast majority of Proof-of-Stake and consensus code for Polkadot and Substrate, including the code for parachains consensus.
    During this time I participated in protocol design and implementation and learned to build and run developer teams.
